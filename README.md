# Portfolio-Modeling-Index-Fund-Creation
Formulated an integer program to select stocks from NASDAQ 100 and a linear program to calculate the optimal portfolio weights. Also, analyzed the performance of portfolio when number of stocks selected varied to mirror the NASDAQ 100 performance

This project talks about a more practical and cost-effective way of creating an index fund using m stocks in the portfolio that closely follows the market index. First we identify the m stocks to be included and subsequently assign optimal weights to them so as to closely follow the market index in the most efficient way. The analysis also covers how changing the number of stocks in our portfolio will impact the tracking error.
